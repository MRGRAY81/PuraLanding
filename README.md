UPDATE!!!!

Maler lite functionality added and tested with my email
can change the looks of it but atleast its in the right place

Added a scroll to top bar. 
not sure if you want it stuck to the bottem of the page
or to scroll with screen???

Need to descuss Fonts cus i can change them now.
And we can sort colors aswell i used the brand collers 
form youe email to me 
but i just used them as place holders 
so i could see what i was eddidting in the code

This is the REAdme so read it 

Working on the back end cyurrently. 
should be on the Main branch soon or atleast the test branch.

TO DO
       Trim the branches  
       Find where the code saves the emails
       Make it create a email list

WHAT GRAY NEEDS TO DO!!!!!!!! 
    
    Save PURA LANDING GRABBY EMAIL.HTML to your desktop 
    Then right click open with. 
    Pick your browser of choice and
    It should open a window with the first build 
    You can even type in an email into the email box. 
    
For some reason it changed the shape a little but that can be fixed later

Don't know where it saves the email list yet I'm working on that. 

trying to figure out the branch system i think iv got it its just implementing it is confusining.

Also trying to figure out the full stack needed 
think were go na usae the right email API one you suggested.
